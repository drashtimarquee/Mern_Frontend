                        <h4>Colour and Chaos: How to Style Your<br /> Space Wes Anderson Edition</h4>
                        <p>Trends around minimalism are colliding with a natural <br />
                            inclination towards colour and decorating your space with <br />
                            decor reminiscent of stories, memories, gifts, and an  <br />
                            expression of personality. The Wes Anderson Style has<br />
                            superseded its name and come to form a trend resonant<br /> with
                            fuller yet organized spaces, colours that mismatch in<br /> the
                            most pleasing manner, and a symmetry that grows on<br /> you.
                            Beyond the Instagram-worthy reels, here’s how you<br /> can
                            experiment with the Wes Anderson aesthetic:<br /> Symmetry:
                            Giving each corner a sense of wholeness. <br /> Think pastel
                            paisley lamps with a splash of character in<br /> the form of
                            accented wall plates, or antique wall shelves<br /> with
                            artifacts and books in varied colours. Each<br /> segment
                            speaks of a unique story. Alternatively, you can<br /> also
                            play around with similar hues and tones from <br />
                            purple, pinks, and dark blues, to bottle green and rust.</p>
